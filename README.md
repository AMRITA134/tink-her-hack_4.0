### Project Description
SheWalks a safety app designed to help women stay safe on their way back home or other places.

### The Problem statement
Women feel unsafe while travelling alone, especially while walking back home. There is a need for a safety app that can send SOS alerts, an  interval check-in system, fake caller id system for users to escape uncomfortable or unsafe situations.
### The Solution
This is why we built SheWalks- a personal safety app that has:
SOS Alert system -where a sos alert message with the current location can be sent
Interval check in the system-when the destination is selected by the user, the walk is initialised a timer begins with a check in . If the user doesn't check in an sos alerts in sent

#### App Flow Diagram

![App Flow](docs/app-flow.png)
1)user enter secret code to enter the app or enter emergency contact numbers
  1.1)if user enter secret code enter the safety app
  1.2)if user enter emergency contacts like 100,101 etc the call is been made.
2)user can select destination from the drop down menu and select 'Start Walk',the timer is initialized .if the user doesn't checks-in within the time limit a sos alert is sent with current location .

- Example: implementation of app hidden inside calculator
- Example: Debugging of sos alert when the timer going off

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "I want to create a calculator as front and whena combination is given the main safety app should open"
- explain the implementation of sos message when the timer goes off

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** 60%

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions
